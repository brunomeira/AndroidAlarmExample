AndroidAlarmExample
===================

This is an android example which has 5 lines with 3 columns.
The first column the user add a time that will activate the alarm
the second column the user select the kind of music(when the user selects the sound the sound is showed up).
the third line makes the user activate or deactivate the alarm.
The preferences are saved on a SharedPreferences object.
